## Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Description:

Flight delay makes flight scheduling the most challenging issue in the
aircraft industry. Several factors are attributed to flight delays such as
weather conditions and technical errors. This project presents a two stage
predictive machine learning model that uses forecasted weather data to
predict whether the flight is delayed or not and the amount of delay,
thereby hoping to improve flight scheduling.
